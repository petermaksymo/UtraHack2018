# UtraHacks2018

##  [Our Project](https://devpost.com/software/iron-man-emulator#updates)

Our final design was a proof of concept of creating a robotic hand that reflected input from a LEAP Motion controller. The [main](./main.cpp) file contains the C++ code that [Peter](https://github.com/petermaksymo) modelled off of the LEAP demo, adapting it to our project's need. [Hankle](https://github.com/AnonymousHankle) created the [motorControler](./motorControler.ino) which allows our Arduino to take the input in the serial port and control the stepper motor and LED on the hand.
